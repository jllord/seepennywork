## Hi!

This is a website I'm creating for my Code for America Project See Penny Work - which is a budget and project visualization tool kit designed for city tax referendum transparency. That's a mouthful.

This is also an expereiment in parallax scrolling! Using tutorial from [Johnathan Nichol](http://f6design.com/journal/2011/08/06/build-a-parallax-scrolling-website-interface-with-jquery-and-css/).
